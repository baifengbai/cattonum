## Package motivation

Categorical features often are a key part of many modern datasets in different industries.  There are several other packages that encode categorical features as numeric features, including `CatEncoders`, `dummies`, `fastDummies`, `h2o`, `makedummies`, and `recipes`.  These packages either provide a more limited selection of encoding options and/or are signifantly larger in scope and much more heavyweight.  `cattonum` aims to provide a one-stop-shop for categorical encodings.  Nothing more, nothing less.
